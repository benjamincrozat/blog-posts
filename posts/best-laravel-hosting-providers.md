## Introduction to Laravel hosting

The internet is full of people ready to use your Laravel applications.

Whether you are a company, a fresh new startup, a freelancer, or a young developer, choosing the right Laravel cloud hosting provider to fully leverage the framework's capabilities is crucial.

If you are in a hurry, here's my recommendation: **[DigitalOcean](/recommends/digitalocean) (which provides the VPS) combined with [Ploi](/recommends/ploi) (which manages the VPS) is my favorite combo** and that's what I use for this very blog.

## Available discounts

Before you continue, know that there are great discounts and bonuses available for some of the providers I recommend in this article:
- [DigitalOcean](/recommends/digitalocean): Get **$200 worth of credit for free**.
- [Ploi](/recommends/ploi): test it for as long as you want with their **free plan**.
- [Vultr](/recommends/vultr): Get **$100 worth of credit for free**.
- [Cloudways](/recommends/cloudways): use the *"CROZAT"* promo code for **10% off for 3 months**.

## The best Laravel cloud hosting providers by price

At first glance, some providers seem really cheap.

But this is because they let you manage your server.

On the contrary, some providers look more expensive, but they take care of a lot of things for you, which lets you invest time and energy is other tasks.

So my recommendation is to think for the long run before choosing.

| Cloud hosting provider | Lowest monthly price | Is managed |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| [Ploi](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/ploi) | Free (+ hosting) | Yes |
| [Vultr](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/vultr) | $2.50 | No |
| [DigitalOcean](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/digitalocean) | $4 | No |
| [Kinsta](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/kinsta) | $7 | No |
| [Cloudways](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/cloudways) | $14 | Yes |
| [HostGator](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/hostgator) | $34.99 | No |

## The best Laravel cloud hosting providers

### Cloudways

![Cloudways' landing page for Laravel developers.](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamincrozat-com/image/fetch/c_scale,f_webp,q_auto,w_1200/https://github.com/benjamincrozat/content/assets/3613731/3bbf17b9-38e8-4581-9310-40229abb7fb8)

[Cloudways](/recommends/cloudways) is a very good alternative to [Ploi](/recommends/ploi) or Laravel Forge. I really like this one. Unlike others, it's a fully managed solution. This means you don't have to worry about creating an account with a cloud provider.

The particularity of Cloudways is that you will be able to tap into hardware from DigitalOcean, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform all at once if you want to. Therefore, you can make sure to serve your users no matter where they are in the world (because the global availability from all providers is combined).

And for the businesses that go all in on content marketing, they even offer a fully managed WordPress hosting solution (meaning they handle everything from security to workload thanks to Kubernetes) that autoscales depending on your traffic.

There's not much to add about Cloudways. It's a good one and you should definitely give it a try.

Oh, by the way, I managed to negociate a promo code for you. **Use "CROZAT" and get 10% for 3 months!** 👀

[Try Cloudways](/recommends/cloudways)

### DigitalOcean

![DigitalOcean](https://life-long-bunny.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/media-library/production/106/conversions/www.digitalocean.com__sctfdo-medium.jpg)

[DigitalOcean](/recommends/digitalocean) has been a fantastic companion for me when combined with [Ploi](/recommends/ploi) or [Laravel Forge](/laravel-forge).

Its droplets, which are essentially Linux-based virtual machines, are full-featured and can be set up in seconds.

This makes it incredibly easy and efficient to manage my cloud infrastructure as I can interact with my droplets via an intuitive UI.

Additionally, the predictable monthly pricing and 99.99% uptime SLA give me peace of mind as I don’t have to worry about unexpected costs or downtime.

With various options available, like Premium CPU-Optimized, Memory-Optimized, and Storage-Optimized droplets, I can choose the right plan based on my workload and the demands of the applications I'm working on. Plus, the free outbound data transfer, monitoring, and firewalls make it a cost-effective solution.

Lastly, the team management feature has been invaluable for collaborating on projects while keeping everything secure. 

Overall, combining [DigitalOcean](/recommends/digitalocean) with [Ploi](/recommends/ploi) has streamlined my development workflow and allowed me to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure.

[Try DigitalOcean](/recommends/digitalocean)

### Ploi

[![Ploi](https://life-long-bunny.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/media-library/production/193/conversions/DUqP0CeRV2vPCh3xT5F6oO9CwFpMO3-metaQ2xlYW5TaG90IDIwMjMtMTAtMTIgYXQgMDUuMDkuNDlAMngucG5n--medium.jpg)](/recommends/ploi)

[Ploi](/recommends/ploi) is an alternative to Laravel Forge that drastically cut cost for the average person and small businesses. It's easy to use and in some areas, it even does better than Laravel Forge. They provide every feature any serious Laravel app needs: one-click server creation and provisionning, push to deploy, load balancing, free SSL certificates, etc. And all of this behind a very easy to use user interface. That's one big advantage over Cloudways for instance.

Currently, Ploi is the service I use to manage the [DigitalOcean](/recommends/digitalocean) Droplet (VPS) of this blog. I don't have a lot of negative things to say about it, it just works!

[Try Ploi](/recommends/ploi)

### Vultr

![Vultr](https://life-long-bunny.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/media-library/production/107/conversions/www.vultr.com__akl39r-medium.jpg)

[Vultr](/recommends/vultr) is especially handy for developers as it allows instant deployment worldwide, offering a vast array of OS combinations and no long-term contracts.

This flexibility meant I could scale up and down on demand and only pay for what I used.

Also, the fact that it runs atop best-in-class AMD and Intel CPUs, with an optional upgrade to NVMe SSD, ensured I had incredible performance at an unbeatable price.

Although I'm not using [Vultr](/recommends/vultr) anymore, I appreciated its powerful add-ons and user-friendly control panel and API that allowed me to spend more time coding and less time managing my infrastructure.

To conclude, it was a great experience using [Vultr](/recommends/vultr) with Laravel Forge, as it offered flexibility, performance, and ease of management essential for any developer.

[Try Vultr](/recommends/vultr)

### HostGator

![HostGator](https://life-long-bunny.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/media-library/production/108/conversions/CleanShot_2023-05-09_at_13.45.53_2x_hivzzy-medium.jpg)

The VPS hosting plans of [HostGator](/recommends/hostgator) are incredibly flexible and come with a full suite of features that developers, like myself, find very useful.

The full root access allowed me to install any necessary software and the unrestricted access to create unlimited email addresses, databases, and FTP accounts made it a breeze to manage my projects. Plus, the weekly off-site backups can be life saving.

While I've moved on to other solutions that better fit my current needs, I can definitely vouch for the reliability and performance of [HostGator](/recommends/hostgator)'s VPS hosting, especially when used alongside Ploi or Laravel Forge.

It's a reliable solution for developers looking to deploy and manage their applications with ease.

[Try HostGator](/recommends/hostgator)

### Kinsta

![Kinsta](https://life-long-bunny.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/media-library/production/110/conversions/kinsta.com_application-hosting__otz1pu-medium.jpg)

[Kinsta](/recommends/kinsta) is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) hosting provider that also is an alternative to [Ploi](/recommends/ploi) and Laravel Forge, and offers fast, secure, and scalable web application hosting.

With over 55,000 developers and digital entrepreneurs, Kinsta offers 25 locations across five continents that offer the fastest Google C2 machines running on Google’s Premium Tier network.

They provides a developer-focused feature set with support for popular languages and frameworks.

[Kinsta](/recommends/kinsta) offers internal connections, dedicated databases, and a choice of data center locations for maximum speed.

Their simple and good looking dashboard provides an easy way to deploy and manage apps, with unlimited users and support for developers by developers.

The support staff is made up of experts, developers, and engineers that provide fast and multilingual support.

[Kinsta](/recommends/kinsta) offers resource-based pricing, so you only pay for what you use, making it simple, transparent, and predictable (but quite costly, though).

## What makes a good cloud hosting provider?

**Reliability** is critical. In my opinion, a good host should be able to deliver the best service with minimal downtime. When your website is reachable, you avoid losing customers to your competitors. Aim for hosts that have at least a 99.9% uptime rate. Such a rate means your website can potentially be down for an hour per year, which is acceptable.

- **Speed** is also important. A good host must provide fast loading times, which is essential for a better user experience and SEO (Google requires your website to load in under 2 seconds). But what makes a fast server?
- **Location**. The closer your server is to your visitors, the faster your website will load. If your server is in the US and your visitors are in Europe, the loading time will be longer. Of course, when you have an international audience, you should set up load balancers to dispatch your traffic all over the world, and tapping into multiple hosts depending on the locations they provide is perfectly fine;</- **Network bandwidth**. The more bandwidth your server has, the faster your website will load. You can manage on servers with 100Mbps bandwidth, given moderate traffic. But if cost is not an issue, go for at least 1Gbps; 👍
- **Hardware**. The more powerful your server is (CPU, RAM and SSD storage), the faster your website will load.

## Is Laravel good for shared hosting?

**While Laravel can totally be used on shared hosting with a few tricks, I can't recommend this kind of environment to run the framework.**

My recommendation is that if you don’t want the hassle of managing a server, you can do just like me for this blog and use [DigitalOcean](/recommends/digitalocean) + [Ploi](/recommends/ploi), which combine the flexibility of virtual private servers and the simplicity of shared hosting.

And if budget is an issue and you are okay with DevOps stuff, a simple $4 [DigitalOcean](/recommends/digitalocean) droplet can do the trick.

## Which database is best for Laravel?

**Laravel provides support for five different databases**:
- MariaDB 10.3+
- MySQL 5.7+
- PostgreSQL 10.0+
- SQLite 3.8.8+
- SQL Server 2017+

Your choice will depend on the specificities of your project. Each database has its pros and cons.

**Every hosting provider I recommend in this article supports them.**

You can either:
- Install the database on the VPS or dedicated server you chose
- Create a managed database that is vertically and horizontally scalable with a few clicks

## Free Laravel hosting: is it possible?

Unfortunately, it seems **there are no worthy free way to host a Laravel application**.

Remember: **if something that costs money to a company is free, it means that YOU are the product.**

However, if you are ready to make compromises, you could host static websites (meaning it's just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for free on these awesome services:
- Cloudflare pages
- Deta.sh
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- Fly.io
- GitHub Pages
- GitLab Pages
- Google Firebase Hosting
- Netlify
- Railway
- Render
- Surge
- Vercel
