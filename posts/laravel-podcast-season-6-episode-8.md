## Introduction

I just finished listening to the latest episode of the Laravel Podcast (you can do the same [here](https://laravelpodcast.com/episodes/cashier-vs-spark-pest-vs-phpunit-and-how-we-manage-remote-teams)), Season 6 Episode 8, and there's a lot to unpack here. Hosted by [Matt Stauffer](https://mattstauffer.com) and [Taylor Otwell](https://x.com/taylorotwell), this episode dives into some of the freshest developments of Laravel the ecosystem. Let's break down what they discussed.

## FrankenPHP: a game changer?

One of the most intriguing topics was [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev). Taylor and Matt discussed this new tool extensively.

Described as a production-grade, super-fast server that combines the functionality of PHP's built-in server and the robustness needed for real-world applications, FrankenPHP is shaping up to be a significant innovation.

It's all about keeping your Laravel app in memory, leading to dramatic performance boosts. For those interested, there's a [Chris Fidao video](https://youtu.be/q6FQaaFZVy4?si=MU1AAi7-UNgLH-Ni) that dives deeper into FrankenPHP.

## Laravel Cashier quick start guide

The discussion then shifted to Laravel's Cashier quick start, which makes it much easier to get started for anyone looking to integrate subscriptions into their Laravel application. More details are available in the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/billing#quickstart).

## The Laravel Worldwide Meetup

I was excited to hear about the revival of the Laravel Worldwide Meetup. Organized by Colin DeCarlo from [Vehikl](https://vehikl.com), it's a fantastic opportunity for developers who don't have access to local meetups. More information can be found on their [website](https://meetup.laravel.com).

## Pest vs. PHPUnit: The battle of test runners

A significant part of the podcast was dedicated to the debate between [Pest](https://pestphp.com) and PHPUnit as the default test runner for Laravel. [Taylor's poll](https://x.com/taylorotwell/status/1744729110163988949) on X indicated a slight preference for Pest, but the decision isn't set in stone. Pest offers numerous advantages, including a cleaner syntax and built-in features like parallel testing. Matt Stauffer also mentioned a video he made about this topic, which is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3tfEtbMTEI).

## How does Taylor Otwell run his team?

Taylor shared insights into how the Laravel team operates, highlighting their reliance on Slack for communication and Basecamp for monthly project outlines and task management. Interestingly, they are considering expanding the team and possibly introducing more structured project management roles.

## Conclusion

In all, this episode was a treasure trove of information, offering insights into the latest Laravel developments.

Also, don't miss this interesting discussion about how long people's `AppServiceProvider` is [here](https://x.com/ianlandsman/status/1744903740329443588?s=20).

Can't wait for the next episode!
